# Machine-Learning-Based-Fraud-Detection
This project uses predictive modeling techniques to identify fraudulent Credit Card transactions on data obtained from European credit card holders made in September 2013.

Please note that this approach can be transferred to other detection analysis in alternatrive domains. The feature extraction process remains similar and can be replicated on many other detection issues.
